# Introduction &nbsp; <span class="fa fa-cogs"></span> 

The last two days arrived at my twitter feed some discussions on how bad are the following sentences at the beginning of your R script/notebook, sparked by @[JennyBryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan)'s slides at the [IASC-ARS/NZSA Conference](http://www.nzsa2017.com/):

> `setwd()`

and

> `rm(list = ls())`

`r htmltools::HTML("{{< tweet 940021008764846080 >}}")`  
`r htmltools::HTML("{{< tweet 940436177219338240 >}}")` 
`r htmltools::HTML("{{< tweet 940582516532105217 >}}")`
</center> 

Jenny Bryan offered a detailed explanation for this, as well as some fixes, in her [tidyverse blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/). The main idea was:  

- To ensure reproducibility within a stable working directory tree. She proposes the very concise `here::here()` but other methods are available such as the  [`template`](https://github.com/Pakillo/template) or the [`ProjectTemplate`](http://projecttemplate.net/getting_started.html) packages..   
- To avoid break havoc in other's computers with `rm(list = ls())`!.

All of this buzz around project self-containment and reproducibility motivated me to finish a minimal directory tree that (with some variations) I have been using for this year's data analysis endeavours.  

It is a extremely simple tree which separates a `/data`, a `/plot` and an `/img` directory inside the main folder (`root`)

- The *data* folder contains both raw data and processed data files saved by R. 
- The *plot* folder contains all the plots saved during the workflow. 
- The *img* folder has every other image (logos, etc) that R takes as an input to build the results. 
- Inside the *root* folder I store the main `.R` or `.Rmd` scripts.  

This ensures that every folder has an unidirectional relationship with the root folder (except the *data* dir in this case). But the important thing is that the paths in the scripts are set *relative* to the root folder, so the entire tree can be copied elsewhere and still work as expected.  

I also added some more features to the tree:  

- An `.Rproj` file.   
- Parametrize the `.Rmd` file.   
- A <span class="texttt">Git</span> repository so the tree can be conveniently cloned or downloaded, with a .gitignore file:   

<div class="button well alert alert-info text-center" id="myButton" onmouseover="alertWarning()"  onmouseout="alertInfo()">
[`git clone https://github.com/aurora-mareviv/ProjectR`](https://github.com/aurora-mareviv/ProjectR)  
</div>


Here is a sketch of how it works:

And here is the actual code of the notebook/script. I have not included regular markdown text outside the R chunks, as this template is intended to be changed and filled with new text each time:

# Script code &nbsp; <span class="fa fa-tree"></span> &nbsp; <span class="fa fa-wrench"></span>

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Installs missing libraries on render!
list.of.packages <- c("rmarkdown", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "Rcpp", "knitr", "Hmisc", "readxl")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages, repos='https://cran.rstudio.com/')
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Working directories

```{r comment="  "}
# directory where the notebook is
wdir <- getwd() 
# directory where data are imported from & saved to
datadir <- file.path(wdir, "data") # better than datadir <- paste(wdir, "/data", sep="")
# directory where external images are imported from
imgdir <- file.path(wdir, "img")
# directory where plots are saved to
plotdir <- file.path(wdir, "plot")
# the folder immediately above root
wdirUp <- gsub("\\ProjectR", "", wdir) 
```


## Data import

```{r comment="  ", eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Data name (stored as a parameter in the Rmarkdown notebook)
params <- NULL
params$dataname <- "cars"
```

```{r comment="  ", eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# MSEXCEL
dataname <- params$dataname # archive name
routexl <- paste(datadir, "/", dataname, ".xlsx", sep="")  # complete route to archive

library(readxl)
mydata <- read_excel(routexl, sheet = 1)  # imports first sheet
```

```{r  comment="  ", eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# CSV / TSV (separated by tabs in this example)
dataname <- params$dataname # archive name
routecsv <- paste(datadir, "/", dataname, ".csv", sep="")  # complete route to archive

mydata <- read.csv(paste(routecsv, sep=""), 
         header = TRUE, 
         sep = "\t",
         dec = ".")

```


## Data operations

```{r comment="  ", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Hmisc::describe(mydata)
head(mydata)
```

```{r comment="  ", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
p1 <- ggplot(mydata, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) + geom_point()
p1
```

## Save plots

```{r comment="  ", eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# TO PDF 
plotname1 <- "p1.pdf"
# TO PNG 
plotname2 <- "p1.png"

routeplot1 <- file.path(plotdir, plotname1)
routeplot2 <- file.path(plotdir, plotname2)
ggsave(routeplot1)  # (see http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html)
ggsave(routeplot2) 
```

## Save data

```{r comment="  ", eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# RDATA
save(mydata, file="data/mydata.RData")
```

```{r  comment="  ", eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# MSEXCEL # not run
dataname2 <- "mydata"  # name we will give to file
routexl2 <- paste(datadir, "/", dataname2, ".xlsx", sep="")   # complete route to future archive

library(xlsx)
write.xlsx(mydata, routexl2) # creates archive in specified route
```

```{r  comment="  ", eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# CSV / TSV (separated by tabs in this example)
dataname2 <- "mydata"  # name we will give to file
routecsv2 <- paste(datadir, "/", dataname2, ".csv", sep="")  # complete route to future archive

write.table(mydata, file = routecsv2, append = FALSE, quote = FALSE, sep = "\t ",
            eol = "\n", na = "NA", dec = ".", row.names = FALSE,
            col.names = TRUE)
```


This script -and the dir tree that contains it- is saving me a lot of time and headaches (where I've put that data?....), I hope it can be also useful for people out there!.   


# Why I did this?

I wanted to show a very basic directory tree (tree stump?) so it could be modified by people with no experience organising code. I am teaching R to some students (asynchronously) and need them to *really* understand how important it is to be tidy with R projects.  
They have no idea of coding so I have to give them tools that:  

- don't scare them,  
- they can use right away with their data,  
- make them... "learn R as you go" ðŸ˜€   


# Future improvements

- Add a *Makefile*?
- Use [Travis.ci](https://travis-ci.org/)?  
- Etc...
