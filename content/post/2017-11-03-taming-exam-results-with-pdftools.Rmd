# Introduction &nbsp; <span class="fa fa-cogs"></span> 

There are several ways to mine tables and other content from a pdf, using R. After a lot of trial & error, here's how I managed to extract global exam results from an international, massive, yearly examination, the [EDAIC](https://www.esahq.org/education/edaic/exam-types/part-i-examination).  

This is my first use case of *"pdf mining"* with R, and also a fairly simple one.  However, more complex and very fine examples of this can be found elsewhere, using both [<span class="texttt">pdftools</span>](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/01/pdftools-and-jeroen/) and [<span class="texttt">tabulizer</span>](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer) packages. 

As can be seen from the original [pdf](../../../content/post/data/EDAIC.pdf), exam results are anonymous. They consist on a numeric, 6-digit **code** and a binary result: "**FAIL / PASS**". I was particularly interested into seeing how many of them passed the exam, as some indirect measure of how *"hard"* it can be.   

# Mining the table &nbsp; <span class="fa fa-wrench"></span>

In this case I preferred <span class="texttt">pdftools</span> as it allowed me to extract the whole content from the pdf:  

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pdftools")
```

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(pdftools) 
txt <- pdf_text("EDAIC.pdf") 
txt[1] 
class(txt[1]) 
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=" "}
library(pdftools)
ruta <- paste(datadir, "/EDAIC.pdf", sep="")
txt <- pdf_text(ruta)
txt[1] 
class(txt[1]) 
```

These commands return a lenghty *blob* of text. Fortunately, there are some `\n` symbols that signal the new lines in the original document.  

We will use these to split the *blob* into something more approachable, using [`tidyversal`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) methods...  

- Split the *blob*.  
- Transform the resulting `list` into a `character vector` with `unlist`.  
- Trim leading white spaces with `stringr::str_trim`.  

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=" "}
library(tidyverse) 
library(stringr) 
tx2 <- strsplit(txt, "\n") %>% # divide by carriage returns
  unlist() %>% 
  str_trim(side = "both") # trim white spaces
tx2[1:10]
```

- Remove the very first row.  
- Transform into a `tibble`.  

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=" "}
tx3 <- tx2[-1] %>% 
  data_frame() 
tx3
```

- Use `tidyr::separate` to split each row into two columns.  
- Remove all spaces.  

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=" "}
tx4 <- separate(tx3, ., c("key", "value"), " ", extra = "merge") %>%  
  mutate(key = gsub('\\s+', '', key)) %>%
  mutate(value = gsub('\\s+', '', value)) 
# tx4[c(1:6, 48:52),]
tx4
```

- Remove rows that do not represent table elements.  

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=" ", eval=TRUE}
tx5 <- tx4[grep('^[0-9]', tx4[[1]]),] 
tx5
```

# Extracting the results &nbsp; <span class="fa fa-star-o"></span>

We already have the table! now it's time to get to the summary: &nbsp; <span class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></span> &nbsp; <span class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down"></span>   

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=" "}
library(knitr)
tx5 %>%
  group_by(value) %>%
  summarise (count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = paste( round( (count / sum(count)*100) , 1), "%" )) %>% 
  kable()
```

From these results we see that the **EDAIC-Part 1** exam doesn't have a particularly high clearance rate.  It is currently done by medical specialists, but its dificulty relies in a *very* broad list of subjects covered, ranging from topics in applied physics, the entire human physiology, pharmacology, clinical medicine and latest guidelines. 

The **EDAIC-Part 2** is an [oral examination](https://www.esahq.org/~/media/ESA/Files/EDUCATION/EDAIC%20Part%20II/Advice%20to%20candidates%20English.ashx) which may take place in English, French, German, Spanish or Scandinavian languages, in which the examinee is evaluated by 4 pairs of examiners in 4 different sessions of 1-hour duration. **Part 2** is currently considered the toughest by examinees.     

Despite being a hard test to pass -and also the exam fee-, it's becoming increasingly popular among anesthesiologists and critical care specialists that wish to stay up-to date with the current medical knowledge and practice.  


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=" "}
write.csv(tx5,"./data/EDAIC.csv", row.names = FALSE)
