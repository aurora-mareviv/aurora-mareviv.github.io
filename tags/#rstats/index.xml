      <description>A new post in blogdown I just copied a new .Rmd file into the folder /content/post . I gave it a different name than the other post, using the date and some explanatory text.
Then, I added an appropriate YAML heading (similar to the previous post, but changing dates and times).
Finally I added some content to the Rmarkdown and saved the changes.

      <title>R Blogdown Setup in GiHub</title>

      <description>The blogdown R package  Finally, -after 24h of failed attempts-, I could get my favourite Hugo theme up and running with R Studio and Blogdown.
After exploring some alternatives, like Shirin’s (with Jekyll), and Amber Thomas advice (which involved Git skills beyond my basic abilities), I was able to install Yihui’s hugo-lithium-theme in a new repository.
However, I wanted to explore other blog templates, hosted in GiHub, like:
 gcushen/hugo-academic jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect and kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme Or this one kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme  The three first themes are currently linked in the blogdown documentation as being most simple and easy to set up for unexperienced blog programmers, but I hope the list will grow in the following months.</description>
