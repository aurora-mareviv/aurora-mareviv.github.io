      <description>Introduction  There are several ways to mine tables and other content from a pdf, using R. After a lot of trial &amp;amp; error, here’s how I managed to extract global exam results from an international, massive, yearly examination, the EDAIC.

      <description>The blogdown R package  Finally, -after 24h of failed attempts-, I could get my favourite Hugo theme up and running with R Studio and Blogdown.
 After exploring some alternatives, like Shirin’s (with Jekyll), and Amber Thomas advice (which involved Git skills beyond my basic abilities), I was able to install Yihui’s hugo-lithium-theme in a new repository.
